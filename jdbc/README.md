# ðŸ“˜ Jdbc: Concepts + Practice

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API in Java that allows developers to
connect to and interact with relational databases using SQL.

It provides methods for querying and updating data in a database from Java
applications. JDBC is essential for building database-driven applications.

### [JDBC Architecture](notes/src/main/java/com/example/architecture/Architecture.java)
- **Driver Manager**: Loads and manages database drivers.
- **Connection**: Represents a session with the database.
- **Statement/PreparedStatement**: Used to send SQL commands to the database.
- **ResultSet**: Represents data retrieved from the database.

[//]: # 'concept-Architecture'

### **Steps in JDBC**
1. Load the JDBC driver.
2. Establish a connection using `DriverManager.getConnection()`.
3. Create a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement`.
4. Execute queries using `executeQuery()` or `executeUpdate()`.
5. Process the `ResultSet` (for queries).
6. Close the connection and resources.

### **Types of JDBC Statements**
- **Statement**: Used for static SQL queries.
- **PreparedStatement**: Used for dynamic queries with parameters. More secure and efficient.
- **CallableStatement**: Used to execute stored procedures.

[//]: # 'concept-Statements'

### **Transaction Management**
- Use `setAutoCommit(false)` to begin a transaction.
- Use `commit()` and `rollback()` to control changes.

### **Connection Pooling**
- Reuses database connections for efficiency. Provided by libraries like HikariCP, Apache DBCP, etc.

### **JDBC Drivers**
- **Type 1**: JDBC-ODBC bridge
- **Type 2**: Native-API driver
- **Type 3**: Network Protocol driver
- **Type 4**: Thin driver (pure Java driver â€“ most commonly used)
